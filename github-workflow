At the beginning:
- fork repo to your github
- from your github repo, clone repo to local machine
- in local repo, git remote add upstream https://github.com/lentata/testRepo.git

Process to update code base:
1) create a new branch if you don’t have one
    - git checkout -b branchName
2) on your branch, commit your code to your branch
    - git status/add/commit
3) git checkout master
    - this checks out your local master
    - do this before rebasing from upstream master (the production code)
4) git pull —rebase upstream master
    - has your local master rebase from master production code (the upstream)
5) git checkout branchName
    - checkout the branch you just committed code to
6) git rebase master
    - has your branch rebase from local repo master (code should be same as prod repo, but you’re working from your local repo)
    - solve merge conflicts if they exist and save files
    - after saving files, git add the files (do NOT commit)
    - git rebase —continue
        - this allows the rebase process to continue for your checked out branch
        - test the code in the browser/console (e.g. nodemon index.js)
7) git push origin branchName
    - push your code to your branch
8) on github in your forked repo, make pull request from your branch
9) notify scrum master to review and accept pull request
